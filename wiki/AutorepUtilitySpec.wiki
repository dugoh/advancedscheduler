= Introduction =

Autorep is a command-line utility used primarily for extracting job definitions and run record information from the database. 


= Details =

  * Default behavior is to report current status for a list of jobs matching a pattern. Patterns will use SQL-style '%' for wildcards (E.g. %job would match anything ending in 'job'. My%job% would match My_New_job_1, My_job, Myjob, etc. )
  * Output JIL for a list of jobs matching the same-style pattern. This is selected via the '-q' switch. 
  * Job names are specified with the -J parameter.

Sample command lines:

 * report the status for all jobs matching the pattern.
 autorep -J My%Job   

 * output JIL for all jobs matching a pattern
 autorep -q -J My_Job%xyz


You can also use the --format parameter to specify a report output format. The default is the normal Autosys-style autorep output. The other two, which are more friendly to statistics collecting scripts and other parsers, are XML and YAML.

Need an autorep script that will:

  * Default behavior is to report current status for a list of jobs matching a pattern. Patterns will use SQL-style '%' for wildcards (E.g. %job would match anything ending in 'job'. My%job% would match My_New_job_1, My_job, Myjob, etc. )
  * Output JIL for a list of jobs matching the same-style pattern. This is selected via the '-q' switch. 
  * Job names are specified with the -J parameter.

Sample command lines:

# report the status for all jobs matching the pattern.
autorep -J My%Job   

# output JIL for all jobs matching a pattern
autorep -qJ My_Job%xyz

More advanced reporting functionality will come along later. I think this
covers the general use case.
